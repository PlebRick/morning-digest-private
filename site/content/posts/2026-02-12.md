Today's alternative media landscape centers on deepening fractures within MAGA over the Epstein files, the end of a controversial ICE operation in Minnesota, and major developments in election law, crypto markets, and nuclear energy.

## The Epstein Files Divide MAGA

The release—or lack thereof—of Jeffrey Epstein documents has created unusual political fault lines. Attorney General [Pam Bondi testified for over five hours](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/epstein-files-took-center-stage-at-bondis-oversight-hearing-here-are-3-big-moments) before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, facing bipartisan criticism over the DOJ's handling of the files. The Trump DOJ was ordered to release 6 million pages but has delivered only 3 million, more than a month past deadline.

The controversy intensified when it emerged that victim names weren't properly shielded while alleged co-conspirators like businessman Leslie Wexner had their names redacted. When Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked the 11 Epstein survivors present if they'd met with DOJ—all raised their hands—and then asked Bondi to apologize for the agency's failures, Bondi refused. The exchange went viral.

Even more striking was the confrontation between Bondi and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who pressed her on the over-redaction of non-victim names. Bondi [responded by calling Massie](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/bondi-doj-congress-epstein-lying) a "failed politician" with "Trump derangement syndrome"—a remarkable attack on a Republican committee member by a Trump appointee. [Alex Jones and Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUSABIWaK7I) both covered the tension, with Jones arguing Bondi is "part of the coverup" while simultaneously defending Trump's historic role in cooperating with Epstein investigators in the mid-2000s.

The rift has created an odd coalition: libertarian-leaning Republicans like Massie and MTG pressing for full transparency, while Trump's own attorney general stonewalls. It's a rare moment where institutional accountability transcends typical partisan lines.

## Minnesota ICE Surge Ends After Citizen Deaths

Border czar Tom Homan [announced Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/homan-trump-ice-immigration-minnesota-minneapolis.html) that Trump has agreed to end the controversial "Metro Surge" operation in Minneapolis-St. Paul, described by DHS as the "largest immigration enforcement operation ever." The deployment of 2,000 federal agents resulted in over 4,000 apprehensions since November—but also sparked a constitutional crisis.

Federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens, Pretti and Macklin Good, during enforcement actions. More damaging still, US District Judge Patrick Schiltz found that ICE violated at least 96 court orders since January 1 alone. The combination of citizen deaths and systematic defiance of judicial authority proved politically untenable, even for an administration committed to aggressive immigration enforcement.

[Tim Pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of64bglZgaw) and others in the MAGA ecosystem framed the withdrawal as Trump "backing down," though Homan emphasized that a smaller footprint would remain temporarily. Federal officers will withdraw over the next week. The episode highlights the practical limits of maximalist enforcement strategies when they collide with constitutional guardrails and local resistance.

## SAVE Act Passes House on Near Party-Line Vote

The House [passed the SAVE America Act](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-save-america-act-trump-backed-election-bill-rcna258614) 218-213 on Wednesday, with only one Democrat—Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas—voting yes. The legislation requires documentary proof-of-citizenship presented "in person" (passport or birth certificate) to register for federal elections, plus photo ID at polling places.

Republicans celebrated the passage as closing a vulnerability in election integrity. [Timcast IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvz1Hwe5B6Q) declared Democrats can no longer "cheat," while Trump himself touted it as preventing non-citizen voting. The Senate path looks difficult: it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) has already signaled opposition.

Critics warn the law could disproportionately impact married women whose legal documents don't match due to name changes—a concern [highlighted by 19th News](https://19thnews.org/2026/02/house-passes-save-america-act-married-women-vote/). Whether the bill becomes law or serves primarily as messaging for the 2026 midterms remains to be seen.

## Canada School Shooting and Media Framing

One of the deadliest mass shootings in Canadian history unfolded at a high school residence in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia. Nine people were killed—eight at the school and two at a nearby house—with 26 injured. The suspect, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound. [CBC reports](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/livestory/active-shooter-alert-tumbler-ridge-secondary-school-bc-live-updates-9.7083740) that Van Rootselaar's mother and brother were among those killed at the secondary location.

[Timcast IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLOxS7nTRbE) focused heavily on the fact that Van Rootselaar was identified as transgender, arguing mainstream media deliberately obscured this detail to avoid complicating preferred narratives about gun violence and gender identity. [LGBTQ Nation confirmed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2026/02/suspect-in-canada-mass-identified-as-18-year-old-trans-woman-heres-what-we-know/) Van Rootselaar's transgender identity and noted a history of mental health struggles.

Mass shootings remain rare in Canada compared to the United States, a fact typically attributed to strict gun control laws. This incident will likely reignite debates on both sides of the border about the intersection of mental health, gun access, and identity politics in media coverage of violence.

## Markets & Bitcoin

### Tesla's $100 Trillion Moonshot

Elon Musk acknowledged that Tesla reaching a $100 trillion market cap is ["not impossible" but requires "enormous work"](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/musk-says-tesla-could-hit-100-trillion-but-needs-enormous-work/)—a statement that would have seemed absurd even two years ago. For context, the current top 10 global companies combined are worth roughly $26 trillion, meaning Tesla would need to be worth four times the entire current top tier.

The path, according to [InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KevS_cbG34), runs through Optimus humanoid robots rather than cars. Tesla plans to produce 100,000 robots monthly within five years, potentially generating $30 billion annually. Long-term deployment of 100 million Optimus units at $100K annual revenue each could produce $10 trillion in revenue. Musk is intentionally slowing automotive growth to focus resources on "Physical AI" and robotics—a pivot that explains recent production slowdowns.

### Bitcoin Bear Market Debate

Bitcoin's 52% decline from its October peak of $126K to February's low of $60K has sparked debate about whether we're in a bear market. [Bernstein analysts](https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-weakest-bear-market-ever-bernstein-predicts-150k-in-2026/) call this the "weakest bear case in history," noting that previous BTC bear markets averaged 80% drawdowns with a 72% minimum. They maintain a $150K year-end target.

The key difference: past crashes were driven by blow-ups, hidden leverage, and exchange collapses (FTX, Terra/Luna). This downturn appears driven by what Bernstein calls a "manufactured crisis of confidence" around the four-year halving cycle theory rather than fundamental failures. [Into the Cryptoverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUJwW3mf6to) explored how low Bitcoin might go, while [Standard Chartered warned](https://www.theblock.co/post/389003/weakest-bitcoin-bear-case-in-history-bernstein-reiterates-150000-price-target) of potential dips to $50K.

Bitcoin is currently trading around $67K, closely tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq in a period of broader market volatility.

### Nuclear Energy's Wall Street Debut

Holtec International is moving toward a potentially $10 billion IPO that would mark the first major mature nuclear company to go public in years. Unlike most nuclear startups with minimal revenue, Holtec [already generates over $500 million](https://longbridge.com/en/news/275534044) in annual profits from decommissioning nuclear plants and handling nuclear waste.

The company's highest-profile project involves restoring Michigan's Palisades Nuclear Plant reactor, which shut down in 2022. Holtec received hundreds of millions in state and federal DOE support for the restart. The IPO would offer one of the few pure-play public investment vehicles for the nuclear energy revival, a theme [InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KevS_cbG34) has been tracking alongside AI infrastructure buildout.

**California's "Jock Tax" Backfires**: Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold earned a $178,000 Super Bowl bonus but [owes California roughly $249,000](https://www.foxla.com/news/super-bowl-lx-players-lose-thousands-californias-jock-tax-athlete-income) in state taxes—a net loss of $71,000 for winning the championship. The state's 14.6% top marginal rate was applied to eight "duty days" spent in California, prorated against Darnold's 3-year, $105 million contract. [Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTdyAgG0zDs) covered the outcry, with former QB Boomer Esiason suggesting California be barred from hosting future Super Bowls.

The firm acquired bankrupt brands like RadioShack, Pier 1, and Dressbarn after raising $230+ million, but allegedly paid at least $5.9 million in "returns" using other investors' money rather than profits. The FBI is conducting a parallel criminal investigation.

**H1-B Visa Hiring Controversies**: [Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH4gk3sjI14) covered reports of job seekers facing "pay to play" battles as the market becomes "flooded with H1-B visas," reigniting debates about tech industry hiring practices and displacement of American workers.

**Trump Economic Predictions**: President Trump predicted the Dow Jones would hit [100,000 points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ClzFHVZzU) and suggested the economy "should be at 15%" growth, according to Valuetainment coverage. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent boasted of a ["blockbuster 2026"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3OoimocwvM) for the U.S. economy, though the aggressive growth targets have raised concerns about dollar stability.
