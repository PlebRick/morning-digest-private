Today's alternative media landscape is dominated by three explosive stories: a deadly school shooting in Canada that's reigniting trans shooter controversies, a major Epstein files showdown on Capitol Hill, and the passage of a contentious voter ID law that Democrats claim will disenfranchise millions.

## Canada School Shooting and Media Coverage Dispute

A mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia left at least eight people dead plus the shooter on February 11th. [Tim Pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLOxS7nTRbE) and [Timcast IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqe94JSoOwk) are focusing heavily on what they characterize as media attempts to "cover up" that the shooter was transgender. According to [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/transgender-ex-student-identified-alleged-suspect-canada-school-mass-shooting-left-least-9-dead) and [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/livestory/active-shooter-alert-tumbler-ridge-secondary-school-bc-live-updates-9.7083740), the suspect was 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, a transgender woman who transitioned six years ago.

The victims included five students aged 12-13, a 39-year-old teacher, and two family members of the shooter — the shooter's 39-year-old mother and 11-year-old stepbrother found dead at a nearby home. Van Rootselaar died by suicide after the attack. Police had responded to the suspect's residence multiple times over several years for mental health concerns and had apprehended Van Rootselaar on different occasions under mental health laws, though authorities say it's "too early to speculate" on motive.

[PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8AVKYsC4ZXQ) highlighted what they describe as "creepy 'Joker-like' behavior" caught on video of the shooter, though the specific content wasn't detailed in available sources.

## The Epstein Files Firestorm

Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a grueling five-hour hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on February 11th that turned into an intense confrontation over the Justice Department's handling of Jeffrey Epstein documents. [Alex Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUSABIWaK7I), [PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqYdyyVNgDk), and multiple other sources covered what they're calling a "coverup" of Epstein's connections.

According to [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/12/pam-bondi-epstein-hearing-key-takeaways), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/11/nx-s1-5707280/pam-bondi-oversight-hearing-department-of-justice), and [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/epstein-files-took-center-stage-at-bondis-oversight-hearing-here-are-3-big-moments), Democrats pressed Bondi hard on DOJ's extensive redactions in released Epstein documents, arguing the agency is protecting powerful individuals rather than survivors. The most striking moment came when all Epstein victims in attendance raised their hands when asked if they'd met with DOJ officials — none had. Bondi refused to turn and face the survivors when asked to apologize directly to them.

Bondi defended herself by calling Epstein a "monster" and apologizing to victims generally, but claimed "pending investigations" prevented fuller disclosure and blamed prior administrations for the document handling issues.

[Alex Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ouAV6mfYo) went deeper, alleging Epstein had connections to the "Trilateral Commission" and was part of a "global intel web." [PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap3xczESw3Q) featured Rep. Ro Khanna discussing a billionaire sultan's ties to Epstein, with the disturbing detail that the sultan reportedly said "I loved the torture video."

Meanwhile, [PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbn913jSWTo) and [Alex Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbn913jSWTo) are backing the position that Trump actually helped stop Epstein, citing a 2006 police call. [Timcast IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMXPMyFVt8) reported on "new proof" showing Trump thanked police for "stopping" Epstein in the 2000s. The ongoing MAGA rift between MTG and Thomas Massie over Epstein connections continues to divide Trump's base.

## SAVE Act Passes House in Near Party-Line Vote

The House passed the SAVE Act 218-213 on February 12th, with [Timcast IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvz1Hwe5B6Q) and others celebrating that Democrats "can't cheat anymore." According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/trump-save-act-house-voter-id.html), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-save-america-act-trump-backed-election-bill-rcna258614), and [UPI](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2026/02/11/save-america-act/2221770861244/), the legislation mandates proof of citizenship (passport or birth certificate) to register for federal elections and requires photo ID at the ballot box, with new mail-in ballot rules requiring ID submission.

The vote was nearly party-line, with all Republicans voting yes and only one Democrat — Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas — breaking ranks to support it. However, the bill faces extremely slim odds in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster. Majority Leader John Thune admitted Republicans "aren't anywhere close to the votes."

Critics point to concerning statistics from the Brennan Center: 21 million Americans don't have readily available citizenship documents, and 2.6 million lack government-issued photo ID. Democrats argue this will effectively disenfranchise millions of legitimate voters, particularly minorities and lower-income Americans.

## California's "Jock Tax" Costs Super Bowl Winner Money

In a bizarre tax quirk, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold actually lost $71,000 by winning Super Bowl LX. [PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTdyAgG0zDs) broke down how Darnold earned $178,000 for the Super Bowl victory but owes California approximately $249,000 in taxes, resulting in a net loss.

According to [Fox LA](https://www.foxla.com/news/super-bowl-lx-players-lose-thousands-californias-jock-tax-athlete-income), [Athlon Sports](https://athlonsports.com/nfl/sam-darnold-has-to-pay-hefty-california-tax-after-seahawks-super-bowl-win), and [Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/business/2026/02/10/sam-darnold-taxes-sports-betting/), California's notorious "jock tax" applies to athletes based on "duty days" in the state. Super Bowl LX was played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on February 8th, triggering California's highest-in-the-nation state income tax of 14.6% (13.3% income tax plus 1.3% disability insurance). With Darnold's 3-year, $105 million contract, the prorated share for approximately eight duty days in California created this absurd outcome where winning cost him money.

## Markets, Bitcoin, and Economic Outlook

### Trump Administration Economic Optimism

[PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ClzFHVZzU) featured Trump predicting the Dow will hit 100,000 — what they're calling a "historic stock market bet." Treasury Secretary Bessent is boasting about a ["blockbuster 2026" for the U.S. economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3OoimocwvM), according to [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/treasury-secretary-predicts-blockbuster-2026-us-economy-dow-hits-historic-milestone) and [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/702050/americans-expect-economic-growth-stock-market-gains-2026.aspx). Wall Street estimates S&P 500 earnings growth at 15.5% for 2026, and 50% of Americans are positive about the stock market versus only 25% negative.

However, [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/05/stock-market-crash-president-trump-2026-data-grim/) notes that historical data shows a median 19% drawdown in midterm election years, and Goldman Sachs forecasts lower returns than 2025 amid concerns over tariff impacts and high valuations.

### Bitcoin's Brutal Decline

[Into the Cryptoverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUJwW3mf6to) is asking "how low will Bitcoin go?" after the cryptocurrency fell below $66,000 in early February, trading around $62,900 — down nearly 30% for the week and 44% from its fall 2025 peak. According to [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/6/crypto-winter-why-is-bitcoin-crashing-despite-trumps-support), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/bitcoin-price-today-70000-in-focus.html), and [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/05/bitcoin-drops-below-usd65-000-heading-to-worst-one-day-drawdown-since-ftx-blowup), the drop intensified in early February with Bitcoin briefly falling below $61,000.

Driving factors include US ETFs switching from buying to selling in 2026, global stock sell-offs, geopolitical uncertainty, and over $2 billion in forced liquidations this week. Bitcoin appears to have lost its "digital gold" safe-haven status and is now being treated as a risk-off asset. [Into the Cryptoverse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7HKMIok6hPE) notes that "when bear markets start, no one believes it at first."

[InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypBMpKbEpnQ) is asking "where's the alpha?" in their 2026 crypto and AI playbook, suggesting investors are scrambling to find opportunities amid the downturn.

### Nuclear Energy Boom

[PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbMKZTYxUz0) covered a developing "U.S. energy boom" with a $10 billion nuclear IPO. According to [Longbridge](https://longbridge.com/en/news/275534044) and [FastBull](https://www.fastbull.com/news-detail/nuclear-powers-biggest-ipo-in-years-is-on-news_7200_0_2025_2_242163_3/NASDAQ-AMZN), Holtec International — a 40-year veteran in the nuclear industry — is preparing an IPO expected to exceed $10 billion valuation with annual revenue over $500 million.

Holtec has leading positions in nuclear plant decommissioning, spent fuel management, and heat exchange equipment, and is developing small modular reactors (SMRs). Proceeds will fund SMR expansion, with projections of 10-20 SMRs under construction in the coming decade at approximately $3 billion each. This would be the largest nuclear energy IPO in years and one of few pure-play nuclear investment opportunities available.

### Tesla's Ambitious Plans

[InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KevS_cbG34) discussed Tesla's "$100 trillion master plan" and "hidden moats," along with something called "the AI Academy," though specifics weren't available in source materials.

## H-1B Visa Controversy

[PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH4gk3sjI14) highlighted how job seekers are being "forced into pay to play hiring battle" as the market is "flooded with H-1B visas." The segment appears to tap into ongoing concerns about foreign workers displacing American applicants and creating a two-tiered hiring system.

## Tai Lopez Fraud Charges

Social media influencer Tai Lopez is facing serious legal trouble. [PBD/Valuetainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsGSOtvyX0g) covered how Lopez allegedly "swindled $112 million" in what the SEC is calling a massive Ponzi scheme. According to the [Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2026/02/10/tai-lopez-sec-230-million-ponzi-scheme-radioshack-pier1/), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sec-rev-ponzi-scheme-tai-lopez-alex-mehr/), and the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26413), the SEC charged Lopez along with Alex Mehr and Maya Burkenroad with fraudulent securities offerings.

The scheme raised approximately $112 million from hundreds of investors between April 2020 and November 2022 for REV portfolio companies including RadioShack, Pier 1 Imports, Dress Barn, and Linens 'N Things. Investor payouts allegedly came from new investors' money rather than profits, with none of REV's brands turning a profit. The SEC claims $16.1 million was misappropriated. The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation and has contacted investors, though no criminal charges have been filed yet.

## Prediction Markets and Insider Trading Concerns

[Timcast IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojq_TLTlUZE) discussed how "prediction markets are going nuts," with Tim Pool explaining concerns over potential insider trading. The segment appears to address the explosive growth of political betting markets like Polymarket and concerns that people with inside information could manipulate these markets for profit.
